# Weather-APP
Using OpenWeather API, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I was able to create a weather web App. The Web App has a search bar on the top that asks you to enter a zip for the area you want to get the weather for and displays 6 windows which are current weather and the next 5 forecasts (in increments of 3 hours)
# Part 1: HTML
Using HTML I created the structure of what I wanted to display on the web app.
# Part 2: CSS
Using CSS I styled the structure I created using HTML.
# Part 3: JavaScript/API
Using JavaScript I gave a function to the web app. The JavaScript also pulls and pushes data from the OpenWeather API.
